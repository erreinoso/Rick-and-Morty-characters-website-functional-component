## Rick and Morty WebSite!üöÄ

The objective of this project is to create a web search engine, where through a call to the Rick and Morty API.
We can visualize a list of characters and we can also filter by character name, specie (human or alien) and select the character we click on a new route.
In addition, through localStorage we can save our data in the browser.

Note: This project is done using hooks. You could find it with class components in [this repo](https://github.com/erreinoso/Rick-and-Morty-characters-website-class-component).

## Final Project - REACT ‚öõÔ∏è

The object is to create a webpage that lets the user display and filter characters from the TV series Rick and Morty.
